<p>In the current world, tons of programming languages exist now, and tons of new ones
are being created.</p>

<h4 id="imperative-programming">Imperative Programming</h4>

<p>I am more confident in <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code>, only familliar with <code class="highlighter-rouge">C++</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Java</code> in some sense.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> is consise and small, but lacks a lot of libraries in its standard. It is used to
  implement critical componenet such as <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">Kernel</a>, <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://github.com/antirez/redis">Redis</a>, etc.
  It worths when the system efficiency overweights the developing speed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">C++</code> is powerful but much too complex. The compiler does a lot of things behind the scene.
  It really costs to learn the specific conditions in the compiler, such as <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/5dhe1hce.aspx">function overloading</a>,
  <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/implicit_cast#Numeric_promotions">Numeric promotions</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_%28C%2B%2B_programming%29">Rule of three</a>, etc.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Java</code> is much simpler than <code class="highlighter-rouge">C++</code>, which is highly portable on JVM and truly object oriented.
  It consists of tons of frameworks and libraries, but is really verbose. It is used to build
  large softwares and is still popuar in big companies which provide web services.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code> is really simple glue language. Due to its simplicity, people around the world not only
  the professional programmers are contributing all kinds of libraries. As it is <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11328920/is-python-strongly-typed">dynamic typing</a>,
  it is hard to build large system.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In my view, the key of Imperative Programming lies in controlling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_%28computer_science%29">side effects</a> which make the
programme hard to reason about and buggy.</p>

<h4 id="how-functional-programming-shines">How Functional Programming shines</h4>

<p>In <code class="highlighter-rouge">Python</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">function</code> is the first class, and it supports some basic FP features such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">reduce</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">list comprehention</code>, etc.
I find it really cool to have the following features,</p>

<ul>
  <li>Suitable for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6957270/what-is-wholemeal-in-functional-programming">wholemeal programming</a></li>
  <li>Easy to reason about as it has no side effects</li>
  <li>Easy to parallelize</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-haskell">Why Haskell</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Completely <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Referential_transparency">referentially transparent</a></li>
  <li>Powerful type system</li>
  <li><a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Haskell_in_industry">Industrial use</a></li>
  <li>Concise</li>
</ul>

<p>As exercise plays an important role in learning, I would like to follow the suggestions in
<a href="https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell">learn haskell</a>, first finish <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/%7Ecis194/spring13/lectures.html">CIS194</a>, then try <a href="https://github.com/NICTA/course">NICITA</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/kamelzcs/cis-194">Here</a> is the source code for CIS194.</p>
