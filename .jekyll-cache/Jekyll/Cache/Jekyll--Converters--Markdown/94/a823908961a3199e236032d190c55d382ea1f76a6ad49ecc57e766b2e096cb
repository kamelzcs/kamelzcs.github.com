<h4 id="quoting">Quoting</h4>

<p>Quoting in Bash actually skips some steps in the previous post:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Sinle quotes(<code class="highlighter-rouge">''</code>) bypass through the Step 10. Everything inside the Single quotes remains untouched.
There canâ€™t be single quotes inside single quotes, even if bashslashes are used.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Double quotes(<code class="highlighter-rouge">""</code>) bypass Step 1 through 4, plus steps 9 and 10. Single quotes inside double quotes
has no effect. But doulbe quotes allow for parameter substitution, command substitution and arithmetic expression 
evaluation. A double quote can be inside another double quote by a backslash.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="eval">Eval</h4>

<p>Eval lets the precess being precessed once more. It tells the shell to take the <strong>eval</strong>â€™s arguments and run them through the command-line
precessing steps all over again.</p>
