<p>In A/B Testing, there is a group of data <script type="math/tex">X = (X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)</script> and <script type="math/tex">Y = (Y_1, Y-2, ..., Y_m)</script>, the metrics we interested in are the difference between these two groups and related confidence.</p>

<h4 id="a-quick-introduction-to-jackknife">A Quick Introduction to Jackknife</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.math.wustl.edu/~sawyer/handouts/Jackknife.pdf">Jackknife</a> is a method of resample, which tries to estimate the bias and variability of an estimator <script type="math/tex">\phi_n(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)</script> by using values of <script type="math/tex">\phi_n(X)</script> on subsamples from <script type="math/tex">X_1, X_2, ..., X_n</script>.</p>

<p>The <script type="math/tex">i^{th}</script> pseudovalue of <script type="math/tex">\phi_n(X)</script> is
<script type="math/tex">ps_i(X) = n\phi_n(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) - (n - 1)\phi_{n - 1}((X_1, X_2, ..., X_n)_[i])</script></p>
