#### 4.1

It takes me several minutes to really understand the quanstion. :(

It really only has something to do with the order of the parameter evaluation.
To restrict the order, the parameters passed in to `cons` should be taken out
explicitly before being used.

{%highlight scheme%}
(define (list-of-values-left-right exps env)
  (if (no-operands exps)
    '()
    (let ((left (eval (first-operand exps) env)))
      (cons left
            (list-of-values-left-right (rest-operands exps) env)))))
{%endhighlight%}

#### 4.2

>A procedure application is any compound expression that is not one of the above expression types. The car of the expression is the operator, and the cdr is the list of operands

The problem lies in the way to determain a procedure which is much too simple.

If it is put at the very beginning, then `(define x 3)` would be recognized as a procedure, the operator of which is
`define` and the operands are `x` and `3`. But at that time, there is no procedure called `define` at all.

{%highlight scheme%}
(define (application? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'call))
(define (operator exp) (cadr exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
{%endhighlight%}
