#### 3.39

1. 101: P1 , P2
2. 121: P2, P1
3. 100: P1 computes `(* x x)`, then P2 completes and sets x to 101, then P1 executes the assignment.

#### 3.41

As `withdraw` and `diposit` are both single modification operations,
it is not necessary to protect the `balance` value, as it would always be valid.

#### 3.42

It seems both of them would work.

#### 3.43

The sum would be kept just because each account is consistent individually.

#### 3.44

Ben is correct.
Exchange requires consitent states for both accounts, while transfer
would be fine as long as the sum of two accounts is correct.

#### 3.45

`serialized-exchange` has locked both accounts, which makes it impossible to
run `deposit` or `withdraw`.
