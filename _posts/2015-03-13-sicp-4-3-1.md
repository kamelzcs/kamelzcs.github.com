I just find `4.3` very hard to understand.
Eventhough I followed the author's ideas, and find it work.

But this time I found even try to understand the callings through debug would be very difficult.

There should be theoretical foundations for this, finally, though [this tutorial][1], I found
the idea befind it is [CPS][4]. There are other materials [here][2], [here][3].

#### 4.35

(define (an-integer-between low high)
  (require (<= low high))
  (amb low (an-integer-between (+ low 1) high)))

(define (a-pythagorean-triple-between low high)
  (let ((i (an-integer-between low high)))
    (let ((j (an-integer-between i high)))
      (let ((k (an-integer-between j high)))
        (require (= (+ (* i i) (* j j)) (* k k)))
        (list i j k)))))

(a-pythagorean-triple-between 1 100)
