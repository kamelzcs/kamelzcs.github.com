>In general, programming languages impose restrictions on the ways in which computational elements can be manipulated. Elements with the fewest restrictions are said to have first-class status. Some of the ``rights and privileges'' of first-class elements are:
>
>*  They may be named by variables.
>*  They may be passed as arguments to procedures.
>*  They may be returned as the results of procedures.
>*  They may be included in data structures.
