>In the environment model of evaluation, a procedure is always a pair consisting of some code and a pointer to an environment. Procedures are created in one way only: by evaluating a lambda expression. This produces a procedure whose code is obtained from the text of the lambda expression and whose environment is the environment in which the lambda expression was evaluated to produce the procedure. 

Important quote from the SICP text, which is the principle to understand the model part.
`Lambda` expression is the key to create a procedure.

Each procedure contains a environment pointer and a code pointer. When calling a procedure, a new environment is derived from the defining environment
with new parameters added in.

Drawing the graphs is time consuming, skip them for now.
