Here is some useful Vim tips

#### Normal 

* `V` multiline copy

* `.` duplicate last command

* ``mz `z`` Marker and go to the last position 

* ``'.`` Jump back to last edited line


* `g;`and `g,` move (forward,backward) through the changelist

* `I` insert at the begin 

* `A` Append to end

* `J` Join two lines

* `>` and `<` indent block(in visual mode)

* `CTRL + A or X` increase or decrease the number

* `%` go to the corresponding `()`,`{}`,`[]`

#### Move

* `fa` go to the next `a` in the line

* `t,` go to before the next `,` 

* `F` and `T` are backward

* `w` go to the start of the next word

* `b/e` go to the beginning/end of this word

* `W` go to the start of the following WORD(space separated only)

* `B/E` go to the beginning/end of this WORD

* `<start position><command><end position>` for example ``y`a`` yank from here to he marked ``a``

* use markers in the way `a z b e`

* `{ }` to move to the beginning/ending of the paragraph

### Zone selection 

```
<action>a<object> and <action>i<object>
```

Action can be any action, for example `d`, `y`, `c`(change), `v`(select in visual mode). The object can be:
`w` a word, `W` a WORD, `s` a sentence, `p` a paragraph. But also, natural character such as ``",',),],}``

```
vi" will select foo.
va" will select "foo" 
```
