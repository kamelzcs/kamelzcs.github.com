Here is some useful Vim tips

#### Normal 

* `V` multiline copy

* `.` duplicate last command

* `I` insert at the begin 

* `A` Append to end

* `J` Join two lines

* `>` and `<` indent block(in visual mode)

* `CTRL + A or X` increase or decrease the number

* `~` toggle the casing of a letter/selection(upper-case/down-case)

* `!!` execute last command

* `<start position><command><end position>` for example ``y`a`` yank from here to he marked ``a``

* use markers in the way `a z b e`

#### Move

* `%` go to the corresponding `()`,`{}`,`[]`

* ``mz `z`` Marker and go to the last position 

* ``'.`` Jump back to last edited line

* `g;`and `g,` move (forward,backward) through the changelist

* `gi` go to the last place you inserted a text

* `Ctrl-o` and `Ctrl-i` to go to the previous/next location you jumped to

* `fa` go to the next `a` in the line

* `t,` go to before the next `,`

* `F` and `T` are backward

* `w` go to the start of the next word

* `b/e` go to the beginning/end of this word

* `W` go to the start of the following WORD(space separated only)

* `B/E` go to the beginning/end of this WORD

* `{ }` to move to the beginning/ending of the paragraph

#### Zone selection

 `<action>a<object> and <action>i<object>`

 Action can be any action, for example `d`, `y`, `c`(change), `v`(select in visual mode). The object can be:
 `w` a word, `W` a WORD, `s` a sentence, `p` a paragraph. But also, natural character such as ``",',),],}``

 `vi"` will select foo.

 `va"` will select "foo"

#### Editing

* `cc` change the entire current line 

* `r` replace the current character

* `R` Enter Insert mode, replacing characters rather than inserting

#### Macro recording

/bin/bash: :q: command not found

  * `q[ key ]` to start recording

  * `q` to stop recording

  * `@[ key ]` to use the macro
