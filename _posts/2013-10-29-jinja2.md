###  Variables ###


\{\{ foo.bar \}\}

\{\{ foo['bar'] \}\}

#### Implementation ####
Sake foo.bar in Jinja2 does the following thing on the Python layer:

* check if there is an attribute called bar on foo.
* if there is not, check if there is an item 'bar' in foo.
* if there is not, return an undefined object.

foo['bar'] works mostly the same with a difference in the order:

* check if there is an item 'bar' in foo.
* if there is not, check if there is an attribute called bar on foo.
* if there is not, return an undefined object.

###Filers###
Variables can be modified by filters.  
{%raw%}{{ name|striptags|title }}{%endraw%}  will remove all HTML Tags from the name and title-cases it.


###Tests###
Tests can be used to test a variable against a common expression.   

{% raw %}
{% if loop.index is divisibleby 3 %}
{% endraw %}
###Comments###
{%raw%}
{# note: disabled template because we no longer use this  
    {% for user in users %}  
        ...  
    {% endfor %}  
#}
{%endraw%}
