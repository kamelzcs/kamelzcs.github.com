#### 1.3

In order to find out the bigger ones, compare them pairwisely.

{%highlight scheme%}
#lang planet neil/sicp

(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(define (sum-of-squares x y)
    (+ (square x)
       (square y)))

(define (bigger x y)
  (if (> x y) x y))

(define (smaller  x y)
  (if (< x y) x y))

(define (bigger-sum-of-square x y z)
  (sum-of-squares (bigger x y)
                 (bigger (smaller x y)
                         z)))
{%endhighlight%}

#### 1.4

This is the first order useage of the function, which is `+`

{%highlight scheme%}
#lang planet neil/sicp

(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
  {%endhighlight%}

#### 1.5

{%highlight scheme%}
#lang planet neil/sicp

(define (p) (p))
(define (test x y)
(if (= x 0) 0 y))
{%endhighlight%}

If it is evaluated in applicative order, then the evaluation of the `(p)` would lead to infinite loop.
While, if it is evaluated in normal order, then `0` would return before it is evaluated.

#### 1.6

{%highlight scheme%}
(if ⟨ predicate ⟩ ⟨ consequent ⟩ ⟨ alternative ⟩)
{%endhighlight%}

`If` is special form becuase it is not a regular expression, which will have its arguments being evaluted at first.

Only`consequent` OR `alternative` will be evaluted, but never both at the same time.

The `new-if` statement will lead to infinite loop.

#### 1.7

For large numbers, such as `(sqrt 20000000000000)` will be trapped in infinite loop.
The guess would be a fixed point which equals `4472135.954995`.
But `20000000000000/4472135.954995 =4472135.955` which is not equal to `4472135.954995` exactly.

The reason is for float number, when the exp bits gets larger, its coificent bits would loose some accuracy.
Accurary lost meet with big exponent number, then this float number becomes inaccurate.
